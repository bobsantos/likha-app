## 1. GRANT OF LICENSE

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the BrandCo trademark, trade name, and associated brand identifiers (collectively, the "Licensed Property") solely in connection with the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of licensed home goods and kitchenware products (the "Licensed Products") within the Territory defined herein.

This license does not include the right to sublicense, assign, or transfer any rights granted hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.

---

## 2. TERRITORY

The license granted under this Agreement applies throughout **North America**, which for purposes of this Agreement means the United States of America (including its territories and possessions), Canada, and Mexico ("Territory"). All royalties shall be calculated and remitted in United States Dollars (USD). For sales denominated in other currencies, Licensee shall apply the average exchange rate published by the Federal Reserve for the applicable reporting period and shall disclose the exchange rates used in each royalty report.

Licensee shall not sell, distribute, or authorize the sale of Licensed Products outside the Territory.

---

The license granted herein covers the following product categories:

- **Home Goods** — decorative and functional items for household use, including wall art, framed prints, canvas prints, throw pillows, blankets, and textile goods bearing the Licensed Property
- **Kitchenware** — food and beverage items and kitchen accessories, including mugs, glasses, bowls, and serving items bearing the Licensed Property

Any expansion of product categories requires a written amendment to this Agreement signed by both parties. Licensee shall not expand into apparel, footwear, or accessories without Licensor's prior written consent.

## 4. TERM

This Agreement shall commence on **June 1, 2025** and shall expire on **May 31, 2028** ("Term"), unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 11 of this Agreement.

---

## 5. ROYALTIES

### 5.1 Royalty Rate

Licensee shall pay Licensor a royalty equal to **nine percent (9%)** of Net Sales of Licensed Products during each Reporting Period ("Royalty"). This rate applies uniformly to all product categories covered by this Agreement.

### 5.2 Royalty Base — Net Sales Defined

"Net Sales" means gross revenue from sales of Licensed Products less the following deductions, to the extent actually incurred and documented:

- Refunds and credits issued to customers
- Promotional credits agreed to in writing with Licensor's prior approval
- Freight charges separately stated on customer invoices

No other deductions from gross revenue are permitted in computing Net Sales. Cash discounts, sales commissions, and overhead expenses shall not be deducted. Royalties are not deductible from Net Sales.

### 5.3 Calculation

Royalty Due = Net Sales x 9%

---

## 6. MINIMUM GUARANTEE

### 6.1 Annual Minimum

Licensee guarantees that royalties paid to Licensor shall not be less than **Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00)** per contract year ("Annual Minimum Guarantee"). A "contract year" means each consecutive twelve (12)-month period beginning on June 1 and ending on May 31 during the Term.

For clarity, the first contract year runs from June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2026, and the full Annual Minimum Guarantee of $30,000.00 applies.

### 6.2 Shortfall Payment

If, at the end of any contract year, the total royalties actually paid for that year are less than the Annual Minimum Guarantee, Licensee shall pay the shortfall amount (the difference between the Annual Minimum Guarantee and actual royalties paid) within thirty (30) days following the end of that contract year. Shortfall payments are not recoupable against future royalties.

---

## 7. ADVANCE PAYMENT

### 7.1 Amount

Upon execution of this Agreement, Licensee shall pay Licensor a non-refundable advance against future royalties in the amount of **Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00)** ("Advance").

### 7.2 Recoupment

The Advance shall be recoupable against royalties earned under this Agreement during the first contract year (June 1, 2025 – May 31, 2026) only. Once royalties earned in the first contract year exceed the Advance amount, all subsequent royalty payments shall be made in full without offset. The Advance shall not be applied against any minimum guarantee shortfall payment.

---

## 8. REPORTING

Payments not received by the due date shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month on the outstanding balance.

---

## 9. AUDIT RIGHTS

Licensor shall have the right, upon reasonable advance written notice of not less than fifteen (15) business days, to audit Licensee's books and records relating to the sale of Licensed Products no more than once per contract year.

## 10. QUALITY STANDARDS

Licensee shall submit pre-production samples of all Licensed Products to Licensor for written approval prior to commercial production. Licensed Products shall conform to all applicable safety standards and regulations for kitchenware and home goods in each country within the Territory where such products are sold.

## 11. TERMINATION

### 11.1 Termination for Cause

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within such notice period. Failure to submit timely royalty reports or make royalty payments shall constitute a material breach.

### 11.2 Effect of Termination

Upon expiration or termination, Licensee shall immediately cease manufacturing Licensed Products. Licensee shall have sixty (60) days to sell off existing inventory ("Sell-Off Period"), subject to full royalty payment on all sell-off sales.
