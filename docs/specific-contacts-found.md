## Outreach Email Template (Draft)

**Subject:** Quick question about royalty tracking for licensing programs

Hi [Name],

I came across your work at [Company] and was impressed by [specific detail - podcast appearance, Hall of Fame, program you built].

I'm building a tool to help brand owners track licensing royalties and would love 20 minutes of your time to understand how you currently manage:
- Contract terms and royalty rate structures
- Quarterly sales reporting from licensees
- Minimum guarantee tracking

In exchange, I'd love to give you early access to the beta (launching in 2 weeks) and incorporate your feedback.

Would you be open to a quick call next week?

Best,
[Your Name]
