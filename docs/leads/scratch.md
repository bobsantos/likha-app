Review

What do you like best about Flowhaven?
The most attractive feature are the reporting capabilities. The platform leverages the analytics horsepower of Salesforce. The custom reports you can create to analyze licensee / licensor performance are boundless.

The support staff is very attentive and high touch not only during the on-boarding process but thereafter as well. This allows fine tuning of features as well as helping us to navigate the reporting tools.

What do you dislike about Flowhaven?
The design approval module is intuitive but could use additional feedback tools to make it more robust.

What problems is Flowhaven solving and how is that benefiting you?
The reporting tools are so robust that it has provided unprecedented visibility into the timeshare required by each partner for any given contract. This information allows our sales team to negotiate accordingly with the data to back up their discussions.
