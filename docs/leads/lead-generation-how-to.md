## 1. LinkedIn Boolean Searches

LinkedIn is the highest-quality source for B2B leads. This section covers how to find licensing managers at small-to-mid-size companies.

### 1.1 Basic LinkedIn Search Setup

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Log into LinkedIn** (linkedin.com)
   - Use your personal account (you need LinkedIn Premium or Sales Navigator for advanced filters, but basic search works too)

2. **Navigate to the Search Bar** (top of page)
   - Click the search bar at the top of any LinkedIn page

3. **Enter Your Search Query**
   - Start with basic keywords like "licensing manager"
   - Do NOT hit Enter yet - we'll add filters first

4. **Click "All Filters" Button**
   - Located below the search bar after you type a query
   - This opens advanced filter panel

5. **Apply Company Size Filter**
   - Scroll to "Company headcount" section
   - Check boxes for:
     - 1-10 employees
     - 11-50 employees
     - 51-200 employees
   - This excludes Fortune 500 companies (too big for MVP)

6. **Apply Job Title Filter** (Premium/Sales Navigator feature)
   - If you have Premium: Use "Title" filter
   - If you don't: Include title keywords in search query itself

7. **Apply Location Filter** (optional)
   - If targeting US only: Select "United States"
   - If global: Leave blank

8. **Click "Show Results"**
   - LinkedIn will display matching profiles

**What Information to Capture:**

For each profile, record:
- **Full Name** (e.g., "Emily Wickerham Randles")
- **Job Title** (e.g., "President, IMC Licensing")
- **Company Name** (e.g., "IMC Licensing")
- **Company Size** (visible on company page, e.g., "11-50 employees")
- **LinkedIn URL** (e.g., linkedin.com/in/emilywickerhamrandles/)
- **Location** (e.g., "Louisville, Kentucky")
- **Profile Notes** (any pain points mentioned in "About" section)

**How to Extract Contact Info:**

LinkedIn doesn't show emails directly. Three methods:

**Method A: Direct Message (if connected)**
1. Send connection request (see Section 1.5)
2. Wait for acceptance (1-7 days)
3. Message directly via LinkedIn

**Method B: LinkedIn Profile Email (if visible)**
1. Open profile
2. Scroll to "Contact Info" section (click contact icon)
3. Some users list email, Twitter, website

**Method C: Email Finder Tools (see Section 7)**
1. Copy LinkedIn profile URL
2. Use Hunter.io or Apollo.io to find email
3. Verify email before sending

**Sample Output (Good Lead):**

```
Name: Eric Karp
Title: SVP Brand Licensing
Company: Vox Media
Company Size: 501-1,000 (may be too large, but worth reaching out)
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/karper/
Location: New York, NY
Notes: Former SVP at BuzzFeed, built licensing from scratch. Podcast guest - open to sharing knowledge.
Pain Points: Managing multiple licensee relationships across categories
Source: LinkedIn search "brand licensing" + media filter
```

**Time Estimate:**
- 5-10 qualified leads per hour
- 1-2 hours = 10-20 leads

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Use Boolean Operators in Search Bar**
   - AND: `licensing AND manager` (both terms required)
   - OR: `licensing OR royalty` (either term)
   - NOT: `licensing NOT Disney` (exclude Disney)
   - Quotes: `"brand licensing"` (exact phrase)

2. **Second-Degree Connections Are Gold**
   - Filter by "2nd-degree connections"
   - You can request introduction from mutual connection
   - Much higher response rate than cold outreach

3. **Save Searches for Daily Updates**
   - After creating search, click "Create search alert"
   - LinkedIn emails you when new profiles match
   - Helps find people who just changed jobs

4. **Check "Activity" Tab on Profiles**
   - Click "Activity" on profile
   - See recent posts/comments about licensing challenges
   - Great conversation starters for outreach

5. **Don't Ignore "People Also Viewed"**
   - Right sidebar shows similar profiles
   - Often reveals entire teams or competitors

### 1.3 LinkedIn Search Workflow (Efficient Process)

**Goal:** Find and save 20 leads in 1 hour

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Open LinkedIn in Browser** (not mobile app - easier to copy/paste)

2. **Open Your Lead Tracker** (Google Sheet, Notion, Airtable)
   - Have it side-by-side with LinkedIn in split-screen
   - Pre-create columns: Name, Title, Company, LinkedIn URL, Notes

3. **Run First Search Query** (e.g., "licensing manager" + filters)

4. **For Each Result in Search:**
   - **Scan Profile (15 seconds)**
     - Check title (is it relevant?)
     - Check company size (under 200 employees?)
     - Check location (acceptable?)
   - **If Qualified:**
     - Copy name, title, company
     - Copy LinkedIn URL
     - Paste into tracker
     - Click "Save" (bookmark icon) to save profile for later
   - **If Not Qualified:**
     - Skip immediately
   - **Set 5-Minute Timer Per Page** (10 results per page)

5. **Review Next Page of Results**
   - Click "Next" at bottom
   - Repeat process

6. **After 20-30 Results:**
   - Switch to different search query
   - Prevents LinkedIn from rate-limiting you
   - Keeps variety in lead sources

7. **End of Session:**
   - Go to "My Items" > "Saved" to see all saved profiles
   - Review and add notes to tracker

**Time Estimate:** 20 leads in 1 hour (3 minutes per lead)

**Pro Tips:**

- **Use LinkedIn's "Open Profile in New Tab"** (right-click > open in new tab)
  - Keeps search results page open
  - Faster than back-button

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Cmd+T (Mac) / Ctrl+T (Windows): New tab
  - Cmd+W (Mac) / Ctrl+W (Windows): Close tab
  - Cmd+C/V: Copy/paste

- **Batch Similar Tasks:**
  - First pass: Just save 50 profiles (10 minutes)
  - Second pass: Extract contact info (30 minutes)
  - Third pass: Write personalized notes (20 minutes)

### 1.4 How to Evaluate Profile Quality (Is This a Good Lead?)

**GREEN FLAGS (Reach Out):**

- Job title includes: "Licensing", "Brand Partnerships", "Royalty", "IP Manager"
- Company size: 1-200 employees
- About section mentions: "managing licensees", "royalty tracking", "contract management"
- Recent posts about licensing challenges or deal announcements
- Profile mentions specific licensees or brands they manage
- Industry: Gaming, entertainment, creator economy, sports, music, fashion
- 500+ connections (active LinkedIn user = more likely to respond)

**YELLOW FLAGS (Maybe, Lower Priority):**

- Job title is generic: "Brand Manager", "Business Development" (may not handle licensing directly)
- Company size: 200-500 employees (getting too big, but worth a shot)
- No LinkedIn activity in 6+ months (may not see your message)
- Profile is sparse (no About section, few details)

**RED FLAGS (Skip):**

- Company size: 1,000+ employees (too enterprise for MVP)
- Job title: "VP" or "SVP" at Fortune 500 (won't respond to cold outreach)
- Industry: Law firm, consulting (they don't manage licensing, they advise)
- Profile mentions: "seeking opportunities" (may be job hunting, not decision-maker)
- Location: Non-English speaking country (unless you're fluent)

**Example Decision Process:**

**Profile A:**
- Name: Sarah Johnson
- Title: "Licensing Manager"
- Company: "Tiny Rebel Games" (51-200 employees)
- About: "Managing merchandise and IP licensing for award-winning mobile games"
- Recent Activity: Posted 2 weeks ago about new licensing deal
- **DECISION: GREEN - Perfect lead**

**Profile B:**
- Name: John Smith
- Title: "Brand Manager"
- Company: "Nike" (10,000+ employees)
- **DECISION: RED - Too large, too generic**

**Profile C:**
- Name: Maria Garcia
- Title: "Business Development Manager"
- Company: "Indie Animation Studio" (11-50 employees)
- About: "Partnerships and licensing for animated series"
- **DECISION: YELLOW - May handle licensing, worth reaching out**

### 1.5 Crafting Effective Connection Requests

LinkedIn limits connection requests to ~100/week for free accounts. Use them wisely.

**When to Send Connection Request:**

- Profile is a strong match (GREEN flag)
- You want to DM them (can't message without connection)
- You have mutual connections (always mention in note)

**When to Skip Connection Request:**

- You already have their email (use email instead)
- Profile is borderline (YELLOW flag) - save request quota
- They're 3rd+ degree connection with no mutual connections

**Connection Request Template (With Note):**

LinkedIn allows 300 characters in connection notes. Use them.

**Template 1: Mutual Connection**
```
Hi [Name], I saw we're both connected to [Mutual Connection]. I'm researching licensing royalty tracking for a project and would love to connect and learn from your experience at [Company]. Thanks!
```
**Character Count:** ~200

---

**Template 2: Podcast/Content Reference**
```
Hi [Name], I heard your interview on [Podcast Name] about building licensing programs. Really insightful! I'm working on royalty tracking tools and would love to connect to learn from your experience.
```
**Character Count:** ~210

---

**Template 3: Direct Value Offer**
```
Hi [Name], I'm building a tool for licensing managers to track royalties and would love your input. Happy to share early access in exchange for 15 min of feedback. Would you be open to connecting?
```
**Character Count:** ~220

---

**Template 4: No Mutual Connection (Generic)**
```
Hi [Name], I'm researching how licensing professionals track royalties and contracts. Your experience at [Company] would be really valuable. Would you be open to connecting?
```
**Character Count:** ~180

---

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Always Personalize** - Mention their company, role, or recent post
2. **Be Specific** - "15 minutes" is better than "quick chat"
3. **Offer Value** - "Early access", "share findings", "introduction to [mutual connection]"
4. **Avoid Salesy Language** - Don't mention product yet, focus on learning
5. **Check Grammar** - Typos destroy credibility

**What NOT to Say:**

- "I'd like to add you to my professional network" (LinkedIn default - lazy)
- "I'm selling a product that..." (instant reject)
- "Can I pick your brain?" (overused phrase, no value offered)
- Generic copy-paste messages (people can tell)

**Response Rate Expectations:**

- With mutual connection: 40-60% accept rate
- With personalized note: 20-30% accept rate
- With generic note: 5-10% accept rate
- No note: 0-5% accept rate

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes per connection request (if personalizing)

## 2. LinkedIn Groups

LinkedIn Groups are communities where professionals discuss industry topics. Great for finding engaged prospects.

### 2.1 Finding Relevant LinkedIn Groups

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Search for Groups**
   - In LinkedIn search bar, type "licensing"
   - Click "Groups" filter below search bar

2. **Evaluate Group Quality**
   - **Member Count:** 500+ members (active community)
   - **Activity Level:** Posts from last 7 days (check feed)
   - **Member Seniority:** Look for managers/directors, not just students
   - **Spam Level:** Avoid groups full of promotional posts

3. **Join 3-5 Groups**
   - Click "Request to Join" (some require approval)
   - Groups to target:
     - "Licensing International Professionals"
     - "Brand Licensing Network"
     - "Indie Game Developers"
     - "Creator Economy Professionals"

**Top LinkedIn Groups to Join:**

1. **Licensing International** (if available)
   - Members: Licensing professionals globally
   - Activity: Conference announcements, job postings, industry news

2. **Brand Licensing & Partnerships**
   - Members: Brand managers, licensing agents
   - Activity: Deal announcements, best practices

3. **Indie Game Developers**
   - Members: Game studio founders, developers
   - Activity: Development tips, business strategy, licensing discussions

4. **Creator Economy Network**
   - Members: Creator managers, brand partnerships
   - Activity: Monetization strategies, merchandise deals

### 2.2 Using LinkedIn Groups to Find Leads

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Open Group** (from "Work" dropdown > "Groups")

2. **Browse Recent Posts**
   - Look for posts asking questions about:
     - "How do you track royalties?"
     - "Best tools for managing licensees?"
     - "Contract management tips?"

3. **Identify Active Members**
   - Who's posting questions? (pain points = potential customer)
   - Who's answering questions? (expertise = good interviewee)

4. **Click on Commenter Profiles**
   - Review profile (same criteria as Section 1.4)
   - If qualified, add to tracker

5. **Engage Before Pitching**
   - Comment on their post with helpful insight
   - Wait 1-2 days
   - Send connection request referencing your comment

**Example Workflow:**

**Post Found in Group:**
> "Hey all, how do you track minimum guarantees across multiple licensing agreements? I'm using Excel but it's a mess. Any tools you recommend?"

**Your Response:**
> "I've heard people use a mix of Excel + calendar reminders, but it's definitely manual. What's the biggest pain point for you - calculation errors or just remembering to check?"

**Why This Works:**
- Shows you understand the problem
- Asks clarifying question (engages conversation)
- Positions you as someone researching solutions (not selling yet)

**Follow-Up Connection Request (2 days later):**
> "Hi [Name], I saw your question in [Group Name] about royalty tracking. I'm researching this exact problem for a project and would love to learn more about your workflow. Would you be open to connecting?"

**Time Estimate:** 30-60 minutes per week (10-15 minutes per group)

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Lurk First** - Spend 1 week observing before posting
2. **Provide Value** - Share articles, insights, templates (build credibility)
3. **Avoid Direct Pitches** - Groups ban self-promotion
4. **DM After Engagement** - Don't pitch in public thread

## 3. Reddit Communities

Reddit is a goldmine for finding people openly discussing pain points. Less polished than LinkedIn, but more authentic.

### 3.1 Finding Relevant Subreddits

   - Audience: Indie game studios and enthusiasts
   - Pain Points: Licensing deals, merch partnerships
   - Activity: High

3. **r/Entrepreneur** (3M+ members)

   - Activity: Low to medium

### 3.2 Reddit Search Techniques

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Navigate to Subreddit**
   - Go to reddit.com/r/gamedev (example)

2. **Use Reddit Search Bar**
   - Click search bar (top right)
   - Ensure "Search in r/gamedev" is selected (not "Search all of Reddit")

3. **Enter Search Query**
   - Example: `licensing royalties`
   - Example: `merchandise contract`
   - Example: `tracking payments`

4. **Sort Results**
   - Click "Sort by: Relevance" dropdown
   - Change to "Sort by: New" (find recent posts = active users)

5. **Review Posts**
   - Look for questions, pain points, complaints
   - Ignore promotional posts (spam)

**Reddit Search Operators:**

Reddit's search is basic, but you can use some operators:

- **Multiple words:** `licensing royalties` (finds posts with both words)
- **Exact phrase:** `"royalty tracking"` (finds exact phrase)
- **Author:** `author:username` (find posts by specific user)
- **Time filter:** Use dropdown "Past Year", "Past Month", etc.

**Search Queries to Try:**

1. `licensing contract` (in r/Entrepreneur)
2. `royalty tracking` (in r/smallbusiness)
3. `merchandise deal` (in r/gamedev, r/indiegaming)
4. `managing licensees` (in r/Entrepreneur)
5. `minimum guarantee` (in r/gamedev)
6. `licensing agreement template` (in r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness)

### 3.3 Identifying Good Leads on Reddit

**What to Look For in Posts:**

**GREEN FLAGS (Good Lead):**

- **User is asking for help:**
  - "How do I track royalties for my game's merchandise?"
  - "Need advice on licensing contract management"
  - "Excel template for royalty calculations?"

- **User describes current pain:**
  - "I'm using a spreadsheet but I keep making errors"
  - "Forgot to track minimum guarantee, now I'm short"
  - "My licensee sent wrong royalty calculation, how do I verify?"

- **User mentions scale:**
  - "I have 3 licensing deals now..."
  - "Just signed 2 more licensees..."
  - "Managing 5 different contracts..."

**YELLOW FLAGS (Maybe):**

- User is just starting (no current deals yet)
- User mentions "looking for licensees" (not there yet)
- Very generic question (may not be serious)

**RED FLAGS (Skip):**

- User is student/hobbyist (no budget, no real need)
- User is promoting their product (spam)
- Post is old (2+ years) and user inactive

**Example Post Analysis:**

**Post 1:**
> Title: "How do you guys track royalties from merchandise deals?"
> Body: "I'm an indie game dev with 3 merch partners (apparel, toys, posters). Each has different rates and quarterly reporting. I'm using Excel but I screwed up last quarter and undercalculated. Any tools or templates you recommend?"
> Subreddit: r/gamedev
> User: u/indiegamedev123 (active for 3 years, posts regularly)

**ANALYSIS: GREEN - Perfect lead**
- Current pain (Excel errors)
- Scale (3 partners = our sweet spot)
- Active user (will likely respond)
- Specific need (royalty tracking)

---

**Post 2:**
> Title: "Thinking about licensing my game IP, where to start?"
> Body: "I haven't signed any deals yet but want to be prepared. What should I know?"
> Subreddit: r/indiegaming
> User: u/newbie2024 (account 1 month old)

**ANALYSIS: YELLOW - Too early, but could nurture**
- No current deals (not immediate customer)
- New account (may not be serious)
- But could be lead in 6 months if they sign deals

---

### 3.4 How to Extract Contact Info from Reddit

Reddit users are often anonymous. You need to find their real identity.

**Method 1: Check Reddit Profile for Links**

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Click on Username** (e.g., u/indiegamedev123)
2. **View Profile Page**
3. **Look for "About" Section** (right sidebar)
   - Some users list Twitter, website, LinkedIn
4. **Check Pinned Posts** (top of profile)
   - Often links to portfolio, company site, social media
5. **Review Post History**
   - Look for posts in r/gamedevclassifieds or similar
   - May include company name, game title

**Method 2: Google Search Their Username**

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Copy Reddit Username** (e.g., indiegamedev123)
2. **Google Search:**
   ```
   "indiegamedev123"
   ```
3. **Add Context if Needed:**
   ```
   "indiegamedev123" game developer
   ```
4. **Check Results:**
   - Twitter/X accounts (often same username)
   - GitHub profiles (if developer)
   - Portfolio websites
   - LinkedIn (sometimes same username)

**Method 3: Check Game/Company Name in Post**

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Find Company/Game Mentioned in Post**
   - Example: "I'm the creator of [Game Name]"
2. **Google the Game Name**
   ```
   "[Game Name]" game
   ```
3. **Find Company Website**
   - Look for "About" or "Team" page
   - Find founder/creator name
4. **Search Founder on LinkedIn**
   - Use name + game/company name

**Method 4: Direct Message on Reddit**

If you can't find their real identity, message them on Reddit.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Click on Username**
2. **Click "Send Message" or "Start Chat"**
   - Message: More formal (like email)
   - Chat: More casual (like DM)
3. **Send Short, Value-First Message**

**Reddit DM Template:**

**Template 1: Respond to Their Post**
```
Subject: Re: Royalty tracking question

Hey! I saw your post about tracking royalties for your merch deals. I'm actually researching this exact problem for a tool I'm building.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to share your workflow? I'd love to understand your pain points better, and happy to share early access to the tool in exchange.

Let me know if you're interested - happy to connect on LinkedIn or email if that's easier.
```

**Template 2: General Outreach**
```
Subject: Question about licensing management

Hi! I saw your posts in r/gamedev and it seems like you've got some experience with licensing deals. I'm researching how indie developers track royalties and contracts.

Would you be open to a quick call to share your experience? I'm building a tool to help with this and would love your input (+ early access if interested).

Thanks!
```

**Pro Tips:**

- **Be Human** - Reddit hates corporate speak
- **Acknowledge Reddit Context** - "Saw your post in r/gamedev" (not "found you online")
- **Offer Value** - Early access, shared learnings, not just "can I pick your brain"
- **Respect Anonymity** - Don't push for real name if they prefer Reddit DM

**Time Estimate:** 15-30 minutes per lead (including research)

**Success Rate:**
- Finding contact info: 30-50% (many Reddit users are anonymous)
- Response rate to Reddit DM: 10-20%
- Better to use Reddit to identify pain points, then find people on LinkedIn

### 3.5 Reddit Engagement Strategy (Alternative to Cold DM)

Instead of cold messaging, engage publicly first.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Find Relevant Post** (pain point about licensing/royalties)

2. **Write Helpful Comment** (NOT a pitch)
   - Share insight, template, or resource
   - Ask clarifying question
   - Offer to DM a resource

**Example:**

**Post:**
> "I'm using Excel to track royalties but I keep messing up the formulas. Any tips?"

**Your Comment:**
> "I've been researching this problem and found that most people struggle with tiered rates and YTD calculations in Excel. Are you tracking multiple licensees or just one? I'm working on a solution and happy to share what I've learned."

**Why This Works:**
- Provides value first (not pitching)
- Positions you as expert (researching the problem)
- Invites conversation (ask question)
- Opens door to DM (offer to share)

3. **If They Respond with Interest:**
   - Reply in thread with more detail
   - Then: "Happy to share more via DM if you want"

4. **Send Reddit DM** (now it's warm, not cold)

**Time Estimate:** 10-15 minutes per engagement

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Answer Questions Before Pitching Product** - Build credibility for 1-2 weeks
2. **Don't Spam Multiple Subreddits** - Mods will ban you
3. **Upvote & Comment on Others' Posts** - Builds karma (credibility)
4. **Avoid "I'm Building a Tool" in First Comment** - Sounds like spam

### 4.3 Extracting Contact Info from Twitter

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Find Relevant Tweet** (e.g., licensing deal announcement)

2. **Click on Tweet Author's Profile**

3. **Check Bio for Contact Info**
   - Email address (sometimes listed)
   - Website link (check About page for contact)
   - LinkedIn link (best for B2B)
   - "DM for business inquiries"

4. **If No Contact Info:**
   - Google their Twitter handle: `"@username" LinkedIn`
   - Check website's About/Team page
   - Use email finder tools (Section 7)

**Example:**

**Tweet:**
> "Excited to announce our new merchandise licensing deal with @BrandXYZ! Can't wait to share the products with our community. #licensing #merchandise"
> - @indiecreator (500K followers)

**Your Action:**
1. Click on @indiecreator profile
2. Check bio: "Business: creator@example.com"
3. Add to tracker:
   - Name: [Check website/LinkedIn]
   - Company: Indie Creator LLC (infer from tweet)
   - Email: creator@example.com
   - Source: Twitter licensing announcement

### 4.4 Engaging Before Pitching (Warm Up on Twitter)

Don't pitch immediately after finding someone. Engage first.

**Engagement Strategy:**

1. **Reply to Their Tweet** (congratulate on deal)
   ```
   "Congrats on the licensing deal! Excited to see what you create with @BrandXYZ. How many partnerships are you managing now?"
   ```

2. **Wait for Response** (1-3 days)

3. **If They Respond:**
   - Continue conversation in thread
   - Then DM: "Would love to learn more about your process - can I email you?"

4. **If No Response:**
   - Still add to tracker
   - Reach out via email (Template: "Saw your announcement on Twitter...")

**DM Template (After Engagement):**

```
Hey! Saw your announcement about the licensing deal with [Brand]. Congrats! I'm researching how creators manage multiple licensing agreements and would love to learn from your experience. Would you be open to a quick 15-min call? Happy to share some tools I'm building in exchange for your insights.
```

**Time Estimate:** 20-30 minutes per day to find 5-10 leads

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Set Up Twitter Lists** - Create list of "Licensing Professionals" to monitor
2. **Use TweetDeck** (if available) - Track multiple search columns at once
3. **Follow Industry Hashtags** - #licensing #brandpartnerships #merchandise
4. **Engage Authentically** - Don't copy-paste same reply to everyone

---

## 5. Discord Communities

Discord is where creators, game developers, and entrepreneurs hang out. Less formal than LinkedIn.

### 5.1 Finding Relevant Discord Servers

**Top Discord Communities for Likha Leads:**

1. **Indie Game Developer Servers**
   - "Indie Game Developers" (search Discord server lists)
   - "Game Dev League"
   - "Brackeys Discord" (if still active)

2. **Creator Economy Servers**
   - "Creator Wizard" (if exists)
   - "YouTuber & Streamer Hub"
   - "Content Creator Community"

3. **Entrepreneur/Small Business Servers**
   - "Entrepreneur Discord"
   - "Startup Grind Community"

**How to Find Servers:**

**Method 1: Discord Server Lists**

1. **Go to Disboard.org** (Discord server directory)
2. **Search:** "indie game dev" OR "creator economy"
3. **Sort by Member Count** (larger = more active)
4. **Click "Join Server"**

**Method 2: Google Search**

```
"discord server" "indie game developers"
```

**Method 3: Reddit**

- Search r/gamedev for "discord server"
- Search r/Entrepreneur for "discord community"
- Join servers mentioned in pinned posts

**Method 4: Ask on Twitter**

```
Tweet: "What are the best Discord servers for indie game developers? Looking to connect with other creators."
```

### 5.2 Discord Server Etiquette (Don't Get Banned)

Discord communities have strict rules against spam. Follow these guidelines:

**DO:**
- Read server rules (usually in #rules or #welcome channel)
- Introduce yourself in #introductions channel
- Lurk for 1-2 weeks before posting
- Provide value (answer questions, share resources)
- DM people ONLY after public conversation
- Ask permission before pitching anything

**DON'T:**
- Cold DM members immediately (instant ban)
- Spam your product in multiple channels (instant ban)
- Copy-paste same message to multiple people (ban)
- Pitch in general channels (read rules first)

**Safe Approach:**

1. **Join server**
2. **Introduce yourself in #introductions:**
   ```
   "Hey! I'm [Name], researching licensing and royalty tracking for indie game developers. Been following this space for [X time]. Excited to learn from the community!"
   ```
3. **Be Active in Relevant Channels** (#business, #monetization, #licensing if available)
4. **Answer Questions** (build credibility)
5. **After 1-2 weeks:** Post your own question or engage 1:1

### 5.3 Finding Leads in Discord Servers

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Join Server** (see 5.1)

2. **Identify Relevant Channels**
   - #business-talk
   - #monetization
   - #licensing
   - #partnerships
   - #general (sometimes)

3. **Search Channel History**

**Discord Search:**
- Click search bar (top right)
- Enter: `from: #channel-name licensing`
- OR: `from: #channel-name royalty`
- OR: `from: #channel-name merchandise`

**What to Look For:**
- "I just signed a licensing deal..."
- "How do you track royalties?"
- "Looking for advice on contract management"

4. **Identify Active Members**
   - Who's posting about licensing/business topics?
   - Click on their profile
   - Check "About Me" section (may have Twitter, website, email)

5. **Engage in Thread First** (Don't DM cold)
   - Reply to their message with helpful insight
   - Wait for response
   - Then: "Happy to share more via DM if you want"

### 5.4 Discord DM Strategy (If Allowed by Server)

Some servers don't allow DMs between members. Check rules first.

**When to DM:**
- After engaging in public channel
- If they asked for help/advice
- If they posted about licensing challenges

**DM Template:**

```
Hey! I saw your message in #business-talk about tracking royalties. I'm actually researching this exact problem for a tool I'm building. Would you be open to a quick call to share your workflow? Happy to give you early access in exchange for feedback.
```

**Shorter Version:**

```
Hey! Saw your post about licensing. I'm researching this space and would love to learn from your experience. 15-min call sometime? I'll share what I'm building in return.
```

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours per week per server

**Success Rate:**
- Finding relevant members: 5-10 per server
- Response rate to DM: 20-30% (if you engaged publicly first)

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Join 3-5 Servers Max** - More is overwhelming
2. **Set Notifications for Specific Channels** - Don't miss relevant discussions
3. **Use Discord Search Heavily** - Months of conversations to mine
4. **Be Patient** - Discord is about community, not cold outreach

---

## 6. Podcast Guest Research

   - OR: Check Spotify/Apple Podcasts show notes

2. **Review Episode List**
   - Look for episode titles mentioning:
     - "Building a licensing program"
     - "Managing licensees"
     - "Royalty tracking"
     - Brand names (small/indie brands)

3. **Open Episode Page**
   - Most podcasts list guest name and title in show notes
   - Example:
     ```
     Episode 42: Building BuzzFeed's Licensing Program
     Guest: Eric Karp, SVP Brand Licensing at BuzzFeed
     ```

4. **Record Guest Information**

   - Title: SVP Brand Licensing
   - Company: BuzzFeed (now Vox Media)
   - Podcast: The Licensing Mixtape
   - Episode: #42
   - Topic: Building licensing programs from scratch

5. **Research Guest on LinkedIn**
   - Search: "Eric Karp" + "BuzzFeed" OR "Vox Media"
   - Find current company (people change jobs)
   - Save profile to tracker

**Sample Output:**

```
Name: Eric Karp
Title: SVP Brand Licensing
Company: Vox Media (formerly BuzzFeed)
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/karper/
Source: The Licensing Mixtape Episode #42
Topic Discussed: Built BuzzFeed's licensing program, manages multiple licensees
Pain Points: (Listen to episode) - Tracking quarterly reports, verifying calculations
Notes: Podcast guest = open to sharing, likely to respond to outreach
Outreach Angle: "Loved your episode on The Licensing Mixtape about..."
```

### 6.3 Outreach to Podcast Guests

Podcast guests are MORE likely to respond because:
- They're already comfortable sharing publicly
- You can reference specific insights from their episode
- They're usually promoting something (open to conversations)

**Outreach Template (LinkedIn or Email):**

**Template 1: Reference Episode**
```
Subject: Loved your episode on The Licensing Mixtape

Hi [Name],

I just listened to your episode on The Licensing Mixtape about building [Company]'s licensing program from scratch. Your insight about [specific quote] really resonated with me.

I'm researching how licensing managers track royalties and contracts, and would love 15 minutes of your time to learn from your experience. Happy to share what I'm building (a royalty tracking tool) in exchange for your feedback.

Would you be open to a quick call next week?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Template 2: Shorter Version**
```
Subject: Quick question about licensing workflows

Hi [Name],

I heard your interview on [Podcast Name] about licensing at [Company]. I'm researching royalty tracking workflows and would love to learn from your experience.

Could I ask you a few questions via email or a quick call? Happy to share early access to the tool I'm building in exchange.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**

- Specific reference (proves you listened)
- Flattery (people love being quoted)
- Clear ask (15 minutes, not vague "pick your brain")
- Value exchange (early access for feedback)

**Response Rate:** 40-60% (much higher than cold outreach)

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours to research 10-15 guests from 1 podcast

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Actually Listen to the Episode** - Don't fake it, they can tell
2. **Quote Something Specific** - "Your point about tiered royalties at minute 23:15..."
3. **Wait 1-2 Weeks After Episode Drops** - They're not overwhelmed yet
4. **Connect on LinkedIn First** - Reference episode in connection note

| Emily Randles | President | IMC Licensing | 11-50 | linkedin.com/in/emilywickerhamrandles/ | erandles@imclicensing.com | Podcast Host | Not Contacted | | Manages multiple brands, podcast host |
```

### 9.2 Lead Prioritization Framework

Not all leads are equal. Prioritize for outreach.

**Priority Tiers:**

**TIER 1: Hot Leads (Contact Immediately)**
- Has direct email or phone
- Current pain point (posted recently about problem)
- Perfect fit (1-5 licensing deals, small company)
- Engaged with you already (LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter)
- **Example:** Emily Randles (has email, manages multiple brands)

**TIER 2: Warm Leads (Contact This Week)**
- 2nd-degree LinkedIn connection (can get introduction)
- Podcast guest (open to sharing)
- Conference speaker (upcoming event to reference)
- Active on social media (likely to respond)
- **Example:** Eric Karp (podcast guest, Vox Media)

**TIER 3: Cold Leads (Contact Next Week)**
- Found via search, no prior engagement
- No mutual connections
- Need to find email via Hunter.io
- **Example:** Random LinkedIn profile from search

**TIER 4: Nurture Leads (Wait & Engage First)**
- Too early (no licensing deals yet)
- May be too large (200+ employees)
- No clear pain point
- **Example:** Startup founder exploring licensing (no deals yet)

**How to Sort:**

1. **Filter by Tier in Tracker**
2. **Start Outreach from Tier 1**
3. **Move to Tier 2 after Tier 1 is done**
4. **Ignore Tier 4 for now (revisit in 3-6 months)**

### 9.3 Daily Lead Generation Workflow

**Quality Checks:**

- [ ] All leads have LinkedIn URL or email
- [ ] All leads match target criteria (1-5 licensing deals, <200 employees)
- [ ] Pain points noted for Tier 1 leads
- [ ] Outreach angle/hook identified for each lead
- [ ] No duplicates in tracker

## 11. Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Prioritizing Quantity Over Quality**
- **Problem:** Adding 100 leads who don't fit criteria
- **Solution:** Every lead should pass "Would they pay $50/mo?" test

**Mistake 2: Not Recording Source**
- **Problem:** Can't replicate what worked
- **Solution:** Always note which search/platform found them

**Mistake 3: Waiting to Have "Perfect" Info**
- **Problem:** Spending 20 min researching 1 lead
- **Solution:** Add to tracker with partial info, fill in later

**Mistake 4: Forgetting to Verify Emails**
- **Problem:** Sending to invalid emails hurts sender reputation
- **Solution:** Always verify before sending (Section 7.3)

**Mistake 5: Not Engaging Before Pitching**
- **Problem:** Cold messages get ignored
- **Solution:** Comment, like, engage first (especially on Reddit/Twitter)

**Mistake 6: Ignoring Second-Degree Connections**
- **Problem:** Missing warm introduction opportunities
- **Solution:** Always check for mutual connections on LinkedIn

**Mistake 7: Only Using One Source**
- **Problem:** LinkedIn gets repetitive, rate limits
- **Solution:** Diversify sources (LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Podcasts)
